<BODY>
Contains classes for parsing trace data, analyzing it, and containing the resulting data in bean classes so that the ARO Data Analyzer can display it.
<p>The model package provides two main types of classes: Analysis Classes, and Bean Classes, as well as enumerations and custom exceptions to support those classes.
<li>Analysis Classes parse trace information like TCP Sessions, HTTP Requests and Responses, Bursts, and RRC states and analyze it.
<li>Bean Classes hold the analyzed information in object format so that it can be processed and displayed by the other classes in the ARO Data Analyzer.

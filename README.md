##Open Source Code Package

The Application Resource Optimizer (ARO) is a diagnostic tool for analyzing mobile web application performance developed by AT&T. ARO allows you to automatically profile an application to optimize performance, make battery utilization more efficient, and reduce network impact.

The ARO Data Collector is the component of the ARO application that captures the data traffic of a mobile device and stores that information in trace files that can be analyzed using the ARO Data Analyzer.

The ARO Data Analyzer is the component of the ARO application that evaluates the trace data collected from an application and generates statistical and analytical results based on recommended best practices.

This Open Source Code Package contains all of the code needed to build both of these ARO components.

**Version:**  
ARO Data Collector 3.1 
ARO Data Analyzer  3.1


**What’s new in Release 3.1?**  

+  **AT&T ARO Data Collector supports IOS**  
AT&T ARO can now collect trace data directly from an iOS device. Connect an iPhone to a Mac computer running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 or OS X Mavericks 10.9 with the AT&T ARO Analyzer and XCode installed. Open the ARO Analyzer on the Mac and use the Start Collector option on the Data Collector menu to begin collecting packet data, device information, and (if selected) a video of the trace from the device. Note: This data collection method has been tested on the following devices: iPhone 4s running iOS 6 through 7, and iPhone 5, 5c, or 5s (running iOS 7).  
  
+  **AT&T ARO Data Collector compatibility with Android versions 4.3 and 4.4**  
The AT&T ARO Data Collector .apk is now supported on devices running Android version 4.3 and has been validated on the Android Nexus running version 4.4. Please note that you must have root level access to your device before running the AT&T ARO Data Collector and collecting application traces.  
 
+  **New AT&T ARO support link**  
A support link has been added to the AT&T ARO Analyzer Help menu that allows you to log in to the AT&T Developer Program and file a ticket with ARO Support.  


**What are the known issues in Release 3.1**  
 
+  **Video Sync/Video Correlation feature:**  This feature allows you to sync externally captured video to PCAP data by placing it in the trace folder. When using this feature in ARO 2.3, note the following:  
	+  Please ensure that the video duration is at least as long as the trace duration.  
	+  Avoid clicking in the Diagnostics Chart when the video is playing; the timing of response may be affected.  
	+  Certain 64 bit Windows 7 computers may have unexpected/random video sync issues. If this occurs, Re-sync the trace to the video.  
	+  Do not use a High Definition (HD) video file with the Video Sync feature.  
	+  Avoid disconnecting the USB cable during the collection of a trace, it may cause unexpected behavior.  
	+  On a Mac computer, the Trace Summary notification window may appear distorted. This will be fixed in a future release.  

+  **USB Video Feature:**  In some cases, the following notification may appear incorrectly when the trace is completed: "Unexpected error accessing device SD card. ADB Connection Error" When this occurs, the trace is intact and the error message can be disregarded.  

+  **Recording video in a trace:**  Some devices may not record video during a trace due to hardware limitations. For these devices, use the USB Video feature to record a video for the trace.  

+  **Loading a trace:**  While loading a trace in the ARO Analyzer, an Out of Memory (OOM) notification (application heap size issue) error may occur, or the message: “ARO Analyzer has reached the maximum memory heap size. Close ARO Analyzer and try again or increase ARO Analyzer’s heap size. Also consider collecting multiple, smaller, more isolated traces.” may appear. This can also occur when the same trace is re-loaded.  
  
+  **AT&T ARO Data Collector support for iOS:**  The following issues can occur on the specified iPhone devices if they are disconnected from a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 and OS X Mavericks 10.9 while a trace is being collected:  
	+  On the iPhone 5c, the ARO Data Analyzer may hang and display an empty pop-up, requiring the Analyzer to be closed.  
	+  On the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4s, the error message “No data Packet captured” may be displayed. The correct error message is “Device got disconnected”.  

+  **AT&T ARO Data Analyzer support for iOS:**  Traces collected from an iPhone connected to a Mac running OS X Mavericks 10.9 do not display network traffic when they are opened in the ARO Data Analyzer on a computer running a Windows OS. The trace will open correctly, but the packet data is captured in the pcapng format which is not yet supported by the AT&T ARO Analyzer on the Windows OS.
